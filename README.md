## Generics

The Generics section introduces the concept of parameterized types, allowing you to write classes and methods that work with different types while providing type safety. Here are the topics covered:

### Bounding

- `Generics/bounding/GenericLowerBoundWildcard.java`: Demonstrates the use of lower bounded wildcards in Generics.
- `Generics/bounding/GenericUpperBounding.java`: Shows the use of upper bounded wildcards in Generics.
- `Generics/classes/NonGenerics.java`: A non-generic class without type parameters.
- `Generics/classes/Print.java`: A generic class with a type parameter `T`.
- `Generics/classes/PrinterRunner.java`: A runner class demonstrating the generic `Print` class.
- `Generics/genericTypeWithTowParameter.java`: Example of a generic class with two type parameters.
- `Generics/nonGenericsRunner.java`: A runner class demonstrating the non-generic class.

### Generic Interface

- `Generics/genericInterface/example/Account.java`: A sample class representing an Account.
- `Generics/genericInterface/example/AccountRepo.java`: A repository class for managing Account objects.
- `Generics/genericInterface/example/Customer.java`: A sample class representing a Customer.
- `Generics/genericInterface/example/CustomerRepo.java`: A repository class for managing Customer objects.
- `Generics/genericInterface/example/Repository.java`: A generic interface for common repository operations.
- `Generics/genericInterface/GenericInterface.java`: Definition of the generic `Repository` interface.
- `Generics/genericInterface/GenericInterfaceImplement01.java`: Implementation of the `Repository` interface for `Account`.
- `Generics/genericInterface/genericInterfaceImplement02.java`: Implementation of the `Repository` interface for `Customer`.

### Generic Methods

- `Generics/methods/GenericMethodDemo.java`: Demonstrates the usage of generic methods.

## Threads

The Threads section explores multithreading in Java, allowing you to perform concurrent execution of tasks. Here are the topics covered:

### Day 03: Synchronized Block

- `Generics/thread/day03SyncBlock`: Directory containing examples related to synchronized blocks.

### Day 04: Thread Pool

- `Generics/thread/day04ThreadPool`: Directory containing examples related to thread pools.

### Day 1

- `Generics/thread/day1`: Directory containing examples related to Day 1 of multithreading.

### Day 2

- `Generics/thread/day2`: Directory containing examples related to Day 2 of multithreading.

### Day 2 (Continued)

- `Generics/thread/day2Continue`: Directory containing examples related to the continued exploration of Day 2 multithreading concepts.
