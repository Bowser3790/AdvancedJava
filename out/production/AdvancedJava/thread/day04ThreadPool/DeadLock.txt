DeadLock Example Real World:

2 friends are each drawing a picture.
there is 1 pencil and 1 eraser.

1 friend is using ruler and 1 is using the eraser

they are each waiting for the other person to release the ruler and eraser so they can use it...

suppose the person1 with the ruler does not release the ruler and they hold on to it.

Person 2 is going to be waiting forever to use the ruler and they will end up in a dead lock situation where you are not
able to use one of the resources to complete the picture.
